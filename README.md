# The Æon Core™ — Open Plasmonic Platform

The Æon Core condenses over a decade of frontier plasmonics research into a compact, manufacturable sensing chip designed for high-sensitivity, real-world detection. This repository provides a downloadable overview of what the Æon Core can detect, how it compares to existing technologies, and the detection architectures it supports.
